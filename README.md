# 🌆 Urban Air Quality and Traffic Congestion Analysis Dashboard

### 📊 Developed Using Power BI  
**Duration:** 2015 – 2019  
**Domain:** Data Analytics / Environmental Insights  
**Developer:** Pavan Kumar V  

---

## 🧭 Overview
This Power BI dashboard provides a **comprehensive analysis of air quality and traffic congestion across major Indian cities**.  
It visualizes key environmental metrics such as AQI (Air Quality Index), pollutant concentrations, and city-level comparisons to uncover meaningful trends and insights.

The project helps understand:
- How air quality has changed over time.
- Which cities are most affected by pollution.
- The relationship between pollutants and urban congestion patterns.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To design an **interactive dashboard** that:
- Visualizes AQI trends across years, months, and cities.
- Highlights key pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, NO2, O3) and their contribution to air quality.
- Provides comparative insights to aid policymakers, researchers, and citizens.

## 📚 Insights Derived
- North Indian cities recorded **consistently higher AQI levels** compared to the south.  
- **Winter months** showed the highest pollution concentration.  
- **PM2.5** emerged as the major pollutant across all metro regions.  
- Noticeable **YoY improvement in AQI** post-2018 in selected regions.
